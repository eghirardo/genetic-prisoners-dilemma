## A Genetic Algorithm for the Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma

This repository contains a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm designed to optimize strategies for the Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma (RPD) problem.

Main files:
- `rpd_utils.py`: contains utility functions and classes for the RPD problem and the genetic algorithm.
- `RPD_Coevolution.ipynb`: contains the Jupyter notebook for running the genetic algorithm and visualizing the results.
